The analysis explores key factors influencing employee turnover, such as age, department, gender, job role, and income. Through various SQL queries, it identifies patterns like which departments have higher attrition rates, which age groups are more likely to leave, and how overtime or income levels affect attrition. The project aims to provide data-driven insights that help organizations understand and reduce employee attrition effectively.
